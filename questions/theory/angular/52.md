# What is the browser support of Angular Elements?

Since Angular elements are packaged as custom elements the browser support of angular elements is same as custom elements support.

This feature is currently supported natively in a number of browsers and pending for other browsers.

| Browser | Angular Element Support |
| --- | --- |
| Chrome | Natively supported |
| Opera | Natively supported |
| Safari | Natively supported |
| Firefox | Natively supported from 63 version onwards. You need to enable dom.webcomponents.enabled and dom.webcomponents.customelements.enabled in older browsers |
| Edge | Currently it is in progress |
